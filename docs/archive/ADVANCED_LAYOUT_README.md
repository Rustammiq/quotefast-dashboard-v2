## Navigation Items

The component supports different navigation configurations:

### Dashboard Navigation
- Dashboard, Projects, Library, AI Models
- Contactpersonen, Offertes, Facturatie
- Email, WhatsApp, Omgeving
- Team, Updates, History

### Custom Navigation
You can extend the `navigationItems` object to add your own navigation sections:

```tsx
const customNavigation = {
  MySection: [
    { title: "Page 1", id: "page1", icon: Home, href: "/page1" },
    { title: "Page 2", id: "page2", icon: Settings, href: "/page2" },
  ]
};
```

## Styling

### CSS Classes

The component includes several utility classes:

- `.custom-cursor-area` - Disables default cursor
- `.glass-card` - Glassmorphism effect
- `.fade-in` - Fade in animation
- `.animate-fade-in-fast` - Fast fade in animation
- `.custom-scrollbar` - Custom scrollbar styling

### Print Styles

Print styles are automatically applied when printing:

- Backgrounds become white
- Text becomes black
- 3D backgrounds are hidden
- Sidebar is hidden
- Optimized for PDF export

## Performance Optimizations

### Integration with Existing Dashboard
The component is designed to work alongside the existing dashboard layout. You can use it for specific pages that need enhanced UI features.

## Troubleshooting

### Custom Cursor Not Working
- Ensure `enableCustomCursor` is set to `true`
- Check that the component is rendered on the client side
- Verify that no other CSS is overriding cursor styles

### 3D Background Not Loading
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure `show3DBackground` is set to `true`
- Verify the Spline iframe URL is accessible

### Print Styles Not Applied
- Use the browser's print preview
- Ensure `enablePrint` is set to `true`
- Check that print media queries are supported

## Future Enhancements

- More animation presets
- Additional cursor styles
- More 3D background options
- Advanced print customization
- Mobile-specific optimizations
