## Usage Instructions

1. **Copy the appropriate system prompt** into LM Studio's system prompt field
2. **Select the right model** for your task:
   - Use `deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b` for technical implementation
   - Use `openai/gpt-oss-20b` for creative design
3. **Use collaboration workflows** for complex projects
4. **Adjust temperature settings**:
   - 0.7 for technical code (more deterministic)
   - 0.8 for creative design (more exploratory)

## Example Prompts

### For Technical Implementation:
```
Create a Unity C# script for a 2D platformer character controller with:
- Smooth movement with acceleration/deceleration
- Jump mechanics with variable height
- Wall jumping and sliding
- Coyote time and jump buffering
- Performance optimized for mobile
```

### For Game Design:
```
Design a progression system for a puzzle game that:
- Gradually introduces new mechanics
- Maintains player engagement
- Provides appropriate challenge
- Includes meaningful rewards
- Supports both casual and hardcore players
```

### For Collaboration:
```
I want to create a multiplayer racing game. Let's start with the technical architecture and then move to the game design and user experience.
